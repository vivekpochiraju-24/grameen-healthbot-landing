      question: "Does this work on keypad phones?",
      answer: "Yes! Our IVR system (dial 1455) is specifically designed to work on all types of phones including basic keypad phones. The system uses voice navigation in local languages, so no smartphone is required."
    },
    {
      question: "What if there's no internet connection?",
      answer: "Our system is offline-first. The Village Health Robot can conduct basic health screenings and store data locally. When connectivity is available, all data syncs automatically to the cloud for AI analysis and doctor consultation."
    },
    {
      question: "Who operates the Village Health Robot?",

    },
    {
      question: "How is my health data protected?",
      answer: "We follow strict data privacy protocols with end-to-end encryption. All health data is stored securely and accessed only with patient consent. We comply with healthcare data protection standards and regulations."
    },
    {
      question: "What medical conditions can be diagnosed?",
      answer: "Our AI specializes in common rural health issues including TB screening, anemia detection, malnutrition assessment, maternal health monitoring, and basic vital sign analysis. For complex cases, remote doctors provide consultation."
    },
    {
      question: "Is there any cost for using the service?",
      answer: "Basic health screening through the Village Health Robot and IVR consultation (1455) are provided at minimal or no cost to ensure healthcare accessibility for all rural communities."
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly can I get medical help in emergencies?",
      answer: "Our system automatically detects emergency conditions and immediately alerts the nearest Primary Health Center (PHC) and ambulance services, significantly reducing response time for critical cases."
    },
    {
      question: "Which languages are supported?",
      answer: "The system supports major local languages including Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Gujarati, Marathi, and others. Voice navigation makes it accessible to non-literate users as well."
